		Whatever your motivation, donating your used and unwanted clothing, shoes, books, and CDs/DVDs in a Recycle That collection box or at a participating Habitat ReStore is good for good for the environment, good for the local community and benefits a local non-profit or community groupy!  Recycle That is committed to the three Râ€™s: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

		DID YOU KNOW?  

		The average US citizen throws away 70 pounds of textiles every year.

		2 MILLON TONS of textiles (clothing, shoes, purses, towels, etc) are diverted from landfills each year by recycling.

		Textile recycling impacts greenhouse gas reduction (2 million tons annually) equal to removing 1 million cars from America's highways.

		45% of donated clothing is re-wearable and can be used by people all over the world.

		Even worn or torn clothing and single shoes can be repurposed or recycled into new uses.

		HOW ARE RECYCLED TEXTILES USED?

		REDUCE consumer waste by redistributing materials vs. new manufacturing

		REUSE products through domestic retail or wholesale outlets or by exporting it to developing countries.

		RECYCLE products to transform them for additional uses, such as turning non-wearable garments and towels into industrial wiping cloths, or material fibers into insulation, stuffing and upholstry padding.

		Charity Recycling Service is a Textile collection company that collects for, buys from, and helps transport clothing and household items for many different charitable non-profit organizations, and some for profit entities. The collection of used products serves two very important purposes.
		The first is to provide sustainable fundraising capabilities by providing an outlet to sell used and unwanted clothing, clothing accessories, and household items. For many charities, these funds are life sustaining to their programs.
		The second purpose is protecting the environment. Our recycling program keeps millions of pounds of unwanted items out of the landfills. Recycling efforts are growing in America, but are still just a small fraction of what we could be recycling.
