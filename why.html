	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		Charity Recycling Service provides superior services in procurement, collection, and distribution of Textile and household products for many different charities, organizations, businesses, and consumers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Charity Recycling Service is a Textile collection company that collects for, buys from, and helps transport clothing and household items for many different charitable non-profit organizations, and some for profit entities. The collection of used products serves two very important purposes.
		The first is to provide sustainable fundraising capabilities by providing an outlet to sell used and unwanted clothing, clothing accessories, and household items. For many charities, these funds are life sustaining to their programs.
		The second purpose is protecting the environment. Our recycling program keeps millions of pounds of unwanted items out of the landfills. Recycling efforts are growing in America, but are still just a small fraction of what we could be recycling.
