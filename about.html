			About Recycling for Charities
		</h1>
		<p>
      Helping to preserve the environment for the generations of the future is an important responsibility for which everyone should be held accountable. The electronic waste from pagers, cell phones, PDA's and digital cameras continues to increase each day, and this waste poses a serious threat to the environment. Unfortunately, until recently, legitimate wireless recycling programs have been few and far between.

      Where RFC Helps 
      Recycling for Charities is a Recycling Organization that allows individuals an opportunity to recycle cellular phones, PDA's, Palm Pilots, digital cameras, and iPods for value that is then donated to the charity of their choice.  Not only is RFC acting as a medium to raise funds for charities, but the organization helps individuals protect the environment as well. 

      For each wireless electronic donation provided, RFC contributes a minimum of $.25 to the foundation or cause selected by the donator*. (learn more about donations) Recycling is beneficial for charities and the environment! When you make a wireless donation, everyone benefits! Donate Online Now.

      Commitment to You 
      Recycling for Charities is committed to recycling mobile phones and wireless gadgets properly. We strive to recycle or refurbish as many of the units we receive as possible. RFC assures you that all electronic waste collected are handled responsibly. The well being of the environment is our primary concern. 

      We work with an authorized system for the acceptance, collection, reuse and recycling or proper disposal of used cell phones, electronic gadgets, PDA's, iPods, iPhones. iPads and Digital Cameras.RFC can provide retail mechanisms for the return, reuse, recycling, or proper disposal of used cell phones if the cell phone is delivered directly to a consumer The take-back of a used cell phone from a consumer who is purchasing a new cellular phone The creation and maintenance of public education to promote the recovery, reuse, and recycling or proper disposal of used cell phones Support reuse as the highest form of recycling No off-shore exporting of scrap, No prison or third-world labor Uphold 100% landfill diversion.

      Recycle Now is a UK campaign to encourage people to recycle more things more often. More than six out of ten of us now describe ourselves as committed recyclers, compared to less than half when the campaign began in 2004.

      From recycling more everyday items like glass and plastic bottles and unwanted electrical goods to reducing our food waste, re-using carrier bags or trying out new things like home composting, thereâ€™s lots we can do to help cut back on the amount of waste we send to landfill.

      Thank you from the Recycle Now team.
